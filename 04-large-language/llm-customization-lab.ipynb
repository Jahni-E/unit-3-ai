    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** LLM is a type of AI that understands and perform human-like texts by learning from large amounts of data.LLM is different from tradtional software because LLM can adapt from different types of data while traditonal software needs specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** What it means to prompt an LLM is to provide with context and questions.This is important because it influences the quality and accuracy of the LLM response.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",

HBUs are known for their commitment to both academic excellence and the development of successful individuals in various fields. They offer quality education, support, and resources for students and the community. - How should I store fresh herbs? - As long as your herbs are fresh and untouched, they won't spoil.
